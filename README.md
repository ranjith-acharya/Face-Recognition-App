# Face-Recognition-App
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image against a database of faces. Here, in this project we manually train the images for face recognition and than we provide an unknown image to recognize against the data present in the database. If found it will show Match Found and the name of the person and if not than it will output as no match found! It uses SQLite for database.
